    <b><h1>Integrated Human Practices</h1></b>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Given our concern about the danger of formaldehyde, we launched this project and designed a formaldehyde detection machine using GM E. coli. During the course, we received help and learnt a lot from different stakeholders. Their critical view and feedback helped us to optimize our project plan and solution design into one that is more effective, feasible, and likely to be successful. 
    </p>
    <h2><b> The Timeline </b></h2>
    <p> The timeline below shows how the engagement with stakeholders shaped our project plan and design. It connects our human practices to the design of our construct, experiments we conducted and the evolution of our formaldehyde detecting device. </p>

    <p><i><b> Figure. 2 Results of our public survey (n=187). </b></i></p>
    <p>
        We were inspired by the local news about indoor air quality (IAQ) and want to study the health effects of indoor air pollution. According to the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, there are several major air pollutants in homes and formaldehyde is one of the most common among them. Studies showed that formaldehyde in home can be coming from burning of fuels in gas stoves, building and furnishing materials, renovation works, new wooden furniture or even food we eat [1].</p>
    <p>There is no doubt formaldehyde can cause serious health issues and is worth attention. However, it is not clear how the general public perceive the problem. As a result, we conducted a public survey in order to gather information about how people in Hong Kong understand indoor formaldehyde pollution. Among the 187 interviewees, most of them are aware of the source and consequence of formaldehyde pollution. We also asked if the interviewees or their family had been affected by formaldehyde pollution, 61% of them reported “yes”, and 53% of the interviewees are willing to pay for the detection of formaldehyde. </p>
    <h3><b>Reflections:</b> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Formaldehyde pollution is a real life issue concerned by many locals.</li>
        <li> Many people are willing to pay for the detection of formaldehyde. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <b>Feedbacks: </b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li> We aimed to develop a biosensor for the detection of formaldehyde. </li>
        <li> Our project is connected to our society by solving a real life problem. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> To begin with, we need to explore if it is possible to make a synthetic organism that can help us to detect formaldehyde in the environment. Since we are high school students, we have basic understanding about genetic engineering but no practical experience. Therefore, after we discussed and made a preliminary design, we consulted Mr. Wong, who had conducted molecular biology experiments in the university and had experience in genetic engineering. Mr. Wong gave us a lot of practical information. This includes conducting a broader literature search to identify more candidates for testing when selecting promoters to increase the chance of finding a suitable one. When selecting reporter genes, it is necessary to consider the detection method and signal strength. For example, the commonly used gfp requires specific wavelengths of light and filters to be observed, which may not be the best choice.</p>
    <h3><b> Reflections: </b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Although identifying more promoters can provide a better chance of success.
             However, our time is limited and cloning takes time, so we need to take a balance between the number of promoters to be tested and feasibility.</li>
        <li> Reporter gene signals can best be observed directly with the naked eye.</li>
    </ul>
