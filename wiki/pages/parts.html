  <td>dTomato - red fluorescent protein codon optimized for <i>E. coli</i></td>
  <td>The coding sequence mentioned corresponds to the dTomato protein, which is responsible for producing red fluorescence. It functions as a dimer and has an approximate molecular weight of 27.0 kDa. The dTomato protein originates from Discosoma, a specific species. Our team has undertaken codon optimization for this coding sequence, and it has been successfully demonstrated to be functional in our experiments.</td>
