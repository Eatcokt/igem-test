      <p>During the experimental phase of our project, we applied the principles of the engineering cycle to structure our project flow, experimental design, and problem-solving approach. This systematic framework greatly aided us in tackling challenges encountered during the cloning process. In the following section, we will describe how we effectively implemented our project by incorporating the key components of engineering design thinking.</p>
      <h1>1. Design</h1>

      <p><b>Inspirtation of the project</b></p>

      <p>In recent local news, there has been a growing concern about indoor air quality (IAQ) and the need to study the health effects of indoor air pollution. The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department has identified various significant air pollutants present in homes, with formaldehyde being one of the most prevalent. Research studies have revealed that formaldehyde can originate from multiple sources, including the combustion of fuels in gas stoves, building and furnishing materials, renovation activities, new wooden furniture, and even the food we consume. This highlights the importance of investigating the impact of formaldehyde on indoor air quality and its potential health implications.</p>
      <P>After consulting with our science teachers, we have gained valuable insights and developed a preliminary idea and direction for designing our project. While we are incorporating synthetic biology concepts into our work, it is crucial to consider that our project's target audience is the general public. Therefore, our main focus should be on creating products that are user-friendly, accessible, and do not require any specialized equipment. We aim to develop solutions that can be easily understood and embraced by the public, emphasizing simplicity and practicality in our design approach. By considering the needs and preferences of the general population, we can ensure that our project resonates with a wider audience and has the potential for real-world impact.</p>
      <p>Consequently, our objective is to develop a device that offers an accessible and user-friendly solution for individuals to monitor formaldehyde levels in their homes. Our aim is to create a device that enables users to easily assess the presence of formaldehyde by simply looking at the device.</p>
