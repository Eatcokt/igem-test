    <h3><b>Preparation of pUC19 vectors for pFrmR constructs</b></h3>
    <B>Amplification of pUC19 vectors</B>
    We transformed pUC19 positive controls into TOP10 competent cells using the heat shock method, following the given protocols at the protocol page. 
    Unfortunately, without a spectrophotometer, we couldn't determine the precise yield of the pUC19 vectors obtained. As a solution, 
    we conducted two sets of restriction digestions using the EcoRI enzyme to convert varying concentrations of the pUC19 vectors into a linearized form.

    <b>Linearization of pUC19 by EcoRI restriction digestion</b>
    Digestion is performed to cut the vector by EcoRI. As we had unknown concentration of pUC19, 
    we performed two sets of digestion which assumed there were 5 µg and 10 µg of pUC19 respectively.

    Then we check the linearization by gel.

    The digestion process appeared to be successful since the digested samples look different compared to the undigested control, 
    so we moved forward with the assembly of the pUC19 vector using our gBlock fragments.

    The table below shows the constructs we have in the form of gBlock fragments. One challenge we encountered was related to the pFrmR-tdTomato construct (BBa_K4813004), 
    which contains regions with a high GC content that proved difficult to synthesize as a single fragment. As a result, 
    we had to redesign the construct and divide it into three separate fragments that would be ordered from IDT gBlock. 
    This approach was necessary to overcome the synthesis difficulties associated with the high GC content regions.
