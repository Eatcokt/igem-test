      <h4>Best Hardware</h4>
      <p>This is a prize for the team that has developed a piece of hardware for synthetic biology. Hardware in iGEM should make synthetic biology based on standard parts easier, faster, better or more accessible to our community. Did your team make a sensor to help teams characterize parts? Did you make a robot that can help teams perform experiments or do cloning more easily? Tell us what your team did for this award!</p>
      <p>To compete for the Best Hardware prize, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form">judging form</a>.</p>

<h1>Hardware</h1>
<hr>
<P> We have genetically modified E.coli so as to detect formaldehyde, a toxic chemical for organisms.  We constructed and transformed the recombinant plasmids pFrmR-dTomato and HxIR13A-dTomato into E.coli. The GM bacteria can synthesise red proteins and turn pink in the presence of formaldehyde. However, the process of producing red proteins requires a period of time so it has to be checked regularly. Thus, we decided to build a machine that can detect the colour change of the GM E.Coli.. By the auto detection of the colour change by the camera, we can know whether the surrounding air contains formaldehyde which is harmful for our health. If we can realise the presence of formaldehyde promptly, we can remove them as quickly as possible, which prevents the pollutants from harming our bodies. </P>

<P>The aims of our project are summarised in the following:</P>

<ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
  <li>We hope to create a more innovative and effective way to solve the problem that the general public are concerned about by using new technologies, new equipment and IT programs to conform to the needs of the public.</li>
  <li>We want to create a more portable device for the public so the size of the machine is reduced as small as possible. Besides, the assemblage can be more convenient due to the special mortise and tenon configuration. This greatly reduces the production time.</li>
  <li>We may also want to use a cheaper way to protect us from being harmed by formaldehyde. The machine we created can be manufactured at a low cost. As a result, everyone in the city can afford to buy the machine and have an assurance.</li>
  <li>Automation is also a necessary feature of the machine. The program proceeds automatically in order to detect the conditions of the solution periodically. Therefore, the machine can perform its function without human manipulation. It can perform its functions automatically and periodically in order to check the condition of colour changes of solution. If colour change is detected, notice would be sent automatically to inform the user. This successfully achieves automation which helps humans by improving its convenience.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In addition to encouraging teams to work with DNA parts and build biological devices in the lab, iGEM also encourages other types of technical solutions for synthetic biology. This can include physical devices (hardware) related to robotic assembly, microfluidics, low-cost measurement devices, to name a few examples. There are many exciting opportunities for hardware innovation in synthetic biology.</p>
