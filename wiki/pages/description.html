    <h2>Bioengineered <i>E. coli</i> for Formaldehyde Detection</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Formaldehyde is a hazardous air pollutant commonly found in indoor environments, originating from various sources such as building materials, furniture, and household products. Exposure to formaldehyde can cause adverse health effects, including respiratory and skin irritation, headaches, and even cancer. Therefore, developing a cost-effective and sensitive method for formaldehyde detection is a pressing need.</li>
      <li>This project aims to create a bioengineered E. coli strain capable of detecting formaldehyde using synthetic biology techniques. By incorporating formaldehyde-sensitive promoters into the bacteria's genetic circuit, we can develop a living sensor that produces a measurable output, such as fluorescence or color change, in response to formaldehyde.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
    <p>To create a formaldehyde-sensing <i>E. coli</i> strain, we propose using one or more of the following formaldehyde-sensitive promoters:</p>
      <li>pFrmR<br>A formaldehyde-inducible promoter in <i>E. coli</i>. Formaldehyde binds to FrmR that is a transcriptional inhibitor of pFrmR promoter. After binding the pFrmR can express the following coding sequence. </li>

    </ul>
