    Team HongKong-JSS identifies indoor formaldehyde pollution as a concern faced by the general public – a real problem to solve. 
    In this page, we want to show how our project connects to the wider world by creating feedback loops 
    between our project and the stakeholders. 
<br>
    Since the core of human practices is to show how our project is good and responsible to the world,
    the first thing we want to do is to clarify our own values. 
<br></h5>
</p>
    <P><b>Why is formaldehyde a problem?</b></p>
    <p>
    According to the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, formaldehyde is a VOC of major health concern. 
    It is a chemical ingredient used in many building materials and fabrics, cleaning fluids and adhesives. 
    Formaldehyde is known to cause eye, nose and respiratory irritation. 
    Formaldehyde is also known to be a potent carcinogen.
    </p>
<br>
    <p><b>Why use GMO to monitor formaldehyde pollution?</b></p>
    <p>
    Indoor air formaldehyde level is commonly determined by handheld formaldehyde meter. 
    However, according to a report by the South China Morning Post [1], “none of the 41 
    meters checked can provide reliable readings on indoor air formaldehyde level”. 
    On the other hand, determining the formaldehyde level by analysis method such as 
    High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or colorimetry are too expensive and tedious for the public. 
    Our project aimed to fill the gap by providing a cheap, convenient and reliable method 
    to show indoor air formaldehyde pollution, which can be used by the public on a daily basis. 
    </p>
<br>
   <p> <b>Could our project be misused? Is it safe?</b></p>
   <p>
    Safety is always our first priority. In our project, we genetically modified 
    E. coli so it can express a red color protein (eTomato) in the presence of formaldehyde. 
    The E. coli strains we used are harmless to humans. We had also engineered a device to utilize the GM E. coli, 
    the bacterial culture will be contained within the device during the whole course and disinfected 
    by bleach at the end, no GMO will be released to the environment.

    <b><h2> Identifying stakeholders and their concerns</h2></b>
    <div class=""col">
    <p>
     Members of team HongKong-JSS come from 5 different schools with a diverse background.
     Relevant stakeholders to our project are identified through an extensive brainstorming session 
     with the entire team.We identified each stakeholder by means of literature and our perception
     of them.We created a stakeholder map that positions each stakeholder to get a full view of
     the situation.

    <p><i><b> Figure 2. Concerns-feedback pyramid of the science sector. Based on suggestions from teachers and university professor, the major concerns are the possibility and accuracy of our GM bacteria.</b></i></p>
    <p> 
      For the science sector, opinions and suggestions received from our science teacher Mr. Chan
      and Mr. Wong are mainly focused on the possibility of using GM <i>E. coli</i> and our device to
      detect formaldehyde. Mr. Wong also suggested that we choose a robust and reliable reporter.
      In response, we performed an extensive literature review and identified pFrmR and HxIR as
      potential candidates for formaldehyde-sensitive promoters. We chose dTomato as the reporter
      as it is an exceptionally bright red fluorescent protein (6X brighter than EGFP). dTomato's
      emission wavelength is 581 nm which makes it visible to the naked eye. Mr Chan has given
      us a lot of valuable suggestions regarding the design and function of our device.

    <p>
      On the other hand, Prof. Tian Linwei from the University of Hong Kong highlighted that one
      major advantage of our product is that GM <i>E. coli</i> is formaldehyde specific. However, only
      showing the presence of formaldehyde in the environment is not useful enough, we need to
      show the correlation between the intensity of color of the bacterial culture and the
      formaldehyde concentration in air. He also pointed out that <i>E. coli</i> is quite different from
      humans, any effect on our GM <i>E. coli</i> may not reflect good or bad in humans.

    <p>Our Feedback:   </p>
    <ol>
      <li> We successfully produced a GM <i>E. coli</i> that can show the presence of formaldehyde.</li>
      <li> The reporter signal can be easily observed by the naked eye.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Limitation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Due to time limitation, the correlation between the color intensity of the bacterial culture and actual formaldehyde concentration in air is yet to be confirmed. </li>
      <li> It would be better if we use model organism genomic similar to humans to reflect how the formaldehyde in the environment math affect human. However, our school laboratory does not have the capacity to handle these model organisms. </li>

    <p><i><b> Figure 5. Concerns-feedback pyramid of the regulation sector. Bio-safety in using GMO and mitigating formaldehyde pollution will be the major concerns. </b></i></p>
    <p>Regarding regulations, we had held a team meeting to study Hong Kong Government’s regulations about bio-safety and indoor formaldehyde pollution. According to The Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance, Cap. 607 (the Ordinance) [2], GMOs intended for contained use, such as GM micro-organisms cultured in laboratories, are not required to notify or document to the authority.</p>
    <p>Regarding indoor formaldehyde pollution, The Government of Hong Kong Indoor Air Quality Management Group has stated that formaldehyde is a common indoor air pollutant, and the health impact of formaldehyde is well documented. Formaldehyde level can be determined by active or passive sampling followed by analysis methods such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or colorimetry [3]. Yet, the cost of these tests are not affordable by the public on a daily basis.</p>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4813/wiki/human-practice-figure-6.jpg" width="600" length="500">
    <p><i><b> Figure 6. We held a team meeting to discuss Hong Kong Government’s regulations about bio-safety and indoor formaldehyde pollution.</b></i></p>
    <h2> Our Feedback:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Safety precautions are taken to make sure the GM <i>E. coli</i> will not be released to the environment during our experiments and prototype testing. </li>
      <li> The E. coli strains we used in our project are non-pathogenic and safe to humans. </li>
      <li> We aimed to provide a cheaper and more convenient alternative to HPLC and colorimetry for public daily use in monitoring formaldehyde pollution. </li>
    </ol>

    <p><i><b> Figure 7. Concerns-feedback pyramid of the user sector. Whether the device is user friendly and the cost of the product are user's major concerns.</b></i></p>
    <p>
      For the users, their major concerns are the cost and user experience. With reference to our public survey, among the 187 interviewees, most of them are aware of the source and consequence of formaldehyde pollution. Some interviewees or their family had been affected by formaldehyde pollution, around half of the interviewees are willing to pay for the detection of formaldehyde.

    <p>We had also performed another survey on 42 people who have just renovated their homes, most of them are willing to pay for formaldehyde detection and removal. However, only some of them are willing to try our device. Among the 24 who choose not to use our product, the major concerns are not user friendly and too costly. </p>

    <p><i><b> Figure 10. Our team conducting public survey to gather public opinions.</b></i></p>
    <p> Our Feedback: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> We incorporated IFTTT to our device, it is a software platform that connects apps and devices from different developers in order to trigger one or more automations involving those apps and devices.</li>
      <li> The device can automatically take readings and notify the user once the bacterial culture changes color (indicating the present of formaldehyde).</li>
      <li> Due to the needs of a color sensor and multiple chips to control the fan, power supply and wifi connection, the production cost of our device can hardly be reduced. <br> On the other hand, we modified the design to make it easier to assemble and  more durable, so it can be reused many times to reduce the cost in the long run.</li>
      <li> The cost of replacing GM <i>E. coli</i> is low. We can charge less for old customers who have already purchased the device. </li>
    </ol>

    <p><i><b> Figure 11. Concerns-feedback pyramid of the industry sector. Their major concerns are whether the produce is efficient and profitable.</b></i></p>
    <p>
      For the industry sector, we interviewed Mr. Maurice Yeung from Gaurice Environment LTD and Mr. Ambrose Kong from Wong's Cleaning Service Company.  They are concerned if the use of GM bacteria can increase the efficiency in testing formaldehyde level and the public perception towards our device. They also expressed concern about the level of formaldehyde our GM <i>E. coli</i> can reflect, they stated that the common standard for indoor formaldehyde level is 0.1ppm, it would be better if the color change of our bacteria matches the standard and not just a random level.

    <p><i><b> Figure 12. We interviewed Mr. Maurice Yeung from Gaurice Environment LTD and Mr. Ambrose Kong from Wong's Cleaning Service Company to better understand how experts within the field value our project.</b></i></p>
    <p> Our Feedback:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Let GM <i>E. coli</i> do the work in detecting indoor formaldehyde pollution can reduce the manpower required in doing the tests. </li>
      <li> With reference to our experiments, GM <i>E. coli</i> can show color change in the presence of formaldehyde within 24 hours, which is comparably effective towards lab tests. </li>
      <li> The use of IFTTT in our device allows automatic detection and notification to the user, which can decrease the response time. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Limitations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Only a portion of the public accept the use of our GM E. coli and device to detect formaldehyde. Many of them still prefer traditional methods.</li>
      <li> The correlation between color change and actual formaldehyde level requires more testing to confirm. </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <b><h2> Reflections</h2></b>
    <p> We understand the necessity of human practices in our project. The amount of information we get when we involve different stakeholders in the project is enormous. During the human practices work, we can realize in what directions we could improve our project, to make it more meaningful to the local community and the world.</p>
    <p>Though our project still has many limitations and issues awaiting to be addressed, we believe we have made some contributions towards iGEM as well as the community. For example, we had shed light on the use of genetic engineered organisms in the detection of air pollutants. We have also demonstrated how the use of online automated platforms can greatly reduce human workload.</p>
    <p>Make sure to read the Integrated Human Practices page. On that page, all interviews with stakeholders are processed and we show how we integrate their feedback in the evolution of our formaldehyde detecting device.</p>
