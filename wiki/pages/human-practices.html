    Team HongKong-JSS identifies indoor formaldehyde pollution as a concern faced by the general public – a real problem to solve. 
    In this page, we want to show how our project connects to the wider world by creating feedback loops 
    between our project and the stakeholders. 

    Since the core of human practices is to show how our project is good and responsible to the world,
    the first thing we want to do is to clarify our own values. 

    Why is formaldehyde a problem?
    According to the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, formaldehyde is a VOC of major health concern. 
    It is a chemical ingredient used in many building materials and fabrics, cleaning fluids and adhesives. 
    Formaldehyde is known to cause eye, nose and respiratory irritation. 
    Formaldehyde is also known to be a potent carcinogen.

    Why use GMO to monitor formaldehyde pollution?
    Indoor air formaldehyde level is commonly determined by handheld formaldehyde meter. 
    However, according to a report by the South China Morning Post [1], “none of the 41 
    meters checked can provide reliable readings on indoor air formaldehyde level”. 
    On the other hand, determining the formaldehyde level by analysis method such as 
    High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or colorimetry are too expensive and tedious for the public. 
    Our project aimed to fill the gap by providing a cheap, convenient and reliable method 
    to show indoor air formaldehyde pollution, which can be used by the public on a daily basis. 

    Could our project be misused? Is it safe?
    Safety is always our first priority. In our project, we genetically modified 
    E. coli so it can express a red color protein (eTomato) in the presence of formaldehyde. 
    The E. coli strains we used are harmless to humans. We had also engineered a device to utilize the GM E. coli, 
    the bacterial culture will be contained within the device during the whole course and disinfected 
    by bleach at the end, no GMO will be released to the environment.

     Members of team HongKong-JSS come from 5 different schools with a diverse background.
     Relevant stakeholders to our project are identified through an extensive brainstorming session 
     with the entire team.We identified each stakeholder by means of literature and our perception
     of them.We created a stakeholder map that positions each stakeholder to get a full view of
     the situation.
